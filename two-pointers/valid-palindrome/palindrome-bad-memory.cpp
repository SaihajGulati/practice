 story (of problem in terms of what should do):
- input: string s of ascii characters
- output: boolean of whether is palindrome
- Requirements: need to make sure that convert to lowercase and remove all punctuation
- Constraints that could help:
- Algo (thinking of): 
two pointers, one going forward and one going back and comparing each time if is same
